# Code-Quiz (Module 4 Challenge)

## Description

This Module 4 Challenge was given to me to complete. The goal was to build a short quiz based off of coding bootcamp knowledge.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this webpage, you can click on "Start Quiz". By doing so, this will take you through a series of 5 questions. Given 75 seconds, you will get to select from 4 answers for each question. Once an answer is selected, the application will tell you if the answer you chose is correct or incorrect. An incorrect answer will subtract 10 seconds from your timer. The quiz is over once the timer runs out or the last question is completed.

## Credits

I worked on this project with my study group peers, Chase Seeberger and Shelby Hutchinson.
